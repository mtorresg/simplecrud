simplecrud
==========
I created this simple CRUD system using PHP. 
There is no that much validation and no CSS was implemented. 

The route to the index is ../index.php. This page will list 
all the users and from there we can access the update and delete options. 

Trying to access update.php and delete.php directly should re-route back 
to the index.php.
